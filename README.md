## Intro

In the pursuit of frictionless technology we have abstracted away the underlying infrastructure powering our world. Instant messaging, video calling, online gaming, and realtime streaming are all modes of interaction that try to replicate an idea of shared presence similar to how its experienced in the real world.

Through this project, the visitor experiences shared presence while replicating the uynderlying network topology that makes the experience possible. By interacting with the screen, the user explores emotional connection by modeling the physical connection of devices abstracted away.

This project takes inspiration from various interactive web experiences, specifically the work of pioneers in this space like Myron Kruger (VIDEOPLACE). Similar to Myron, this project attempts to explore how technology can be a medium for connection by replicating a user's identity and modeling shared space in a way that feels real.


## Technical Overview

connections is an interactive experience that displays the current set users currently on the page, and the signals that make their connection possible. By showing the users' ip addresses as well as the corresponding hops between them and the server, you can see a full map of activity happening behind the scenes.
