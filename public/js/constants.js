const projectText = `In the pursuit of frictionless technology we have abstracted away the underlying infrastructure powering our world. Instant messaging, video calling, online gaming, and realtime streaming all introduce interaction models that attempt to replicate an idea of shared presence similar to how its experienced in the real world. <br><br>

Through this project, the visitor experiences shared presence while replicating the underlying network topology that makes the experience possible. By interacting with the screen, the user explores ideas of connection through modeling the physical connection of digital devices.<br><br>

This project takes inspiration from various interactive web experiences, specifically the work of pioneers in this space like Myron Kruger's VIDEOPLACE. Similar to Myron, this project attempts to explore how technology can be a medium for connection by replicating a user's identity and modeling shared space in a way that feels tangible.`;
